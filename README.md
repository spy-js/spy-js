Full documentation writing is in progress, in short for now:

Install node.js v0.8 or newer from http://nodejs.org

Download latest version from http://spy-js.com

Windows users can use spy-js.exe, other platform users (and windows users if spy-js.exe doesn't work) should run: 
```shell
node spy.js
```
and manually configure browser proxy settings to use spy-js URL, by default localhost:3546

See sampleConfig.js as an example of configuration file.
